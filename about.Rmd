3rd year PhD student in the [Energy and Resources Group](https://erg.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley

I am in grad school due to a fascination with the idea of **progress**, from individuals carving out a meaningful life to countries directing resources and writing laws. Under that umbrella, my work has explored household consumption's relationship to social relationships and environmental impacts, factory worker wages, the clothing industry's self-regulation, product transparency, the social cost of carbon, and air pollution's health impacts. My methods are varied, from data analysis to surveys and interviews, and from literature reviews to field experiments.  

I aim for real-world relevance through academic rigor, and I often work with partners outside academia. I have been funded by the National Science Foundation as well as grants from the Tides Foundation and C&A Foundation.

# FAQ {.tabset}

## Why is this needed?
Working with Github is great for version control and collaborating on projects. Many of my project partners have expressed fear about working with Github and especially working with the Terminal. 

I've found that you only need to know a few basic steps to get up and going. 

## Who is this for?
This is for new users to Github. The users should have some familiarity to coding, but this is not exactly needed. *Disclaimer*: These guidelines are for Mac OSX users, but I believe are easily transferrable to Windows.

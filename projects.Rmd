My academic work has mostly focused on the dream of data solving sustainable production and consumption. With that as the backbone, my dissertation spanned consumer behavior change efforts, factory innovations, and non-governmental regulation. Most of this research was focused on the apparel industry, and took place in Thailand, Bangladesh, and China. I also have experience with data science projects relating to wildfires, oil refinery pollution, and the social cost of carbon. I have teaching experience in data ethics as well as data science and sustainability.

I aim for real world relevance and academic rigor, and I often work with partners outside academia. I have been funded by the National Science Foundation as well as grants from the Tides Foundation and C&A Foundation.
